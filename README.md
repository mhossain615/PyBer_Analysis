# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

From working and creating graphs for different datasets. Our manager has given us a new assignment, We are tasked with creating a summary dataframe by city types. then creating a multi-line graph that would show total weekly dares for each city type. 


## Results


From our summary we can see that:

Rural has the highest average fare per driver but lower total rides and lower total drivers
Suburban has more rides and drivers but a lower average fare per ride and driver
Urban has the most total rides and drivers but the lowest Average per ride and driver

Which tells us the lower drivers and rides in a neighborhood creates higher fares.
Urban has the most total fares but it does have more then twice the amount of what rural has.

I have also included a picture showing the difference between the two
[![Summary](/master/Resources/PyBer_ride_data.csv)

and to make things easier i have also included a chart which shows 
[FareChart](https://github.com/mhossain615/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/Fare_summary.png)


## Conclusion

This is a very concluisve assignment we gathered how fares can correlate with the location and also the difference between the 3 neighborhoods as needed. But to improve on this we can also bring in the average yearly income of the citizens in different areas which can give more information as to why places spend more or less.
